# DAA_CIA1&2
Alignment Matrix:
-Two genetic sequnce algorithms of length 12 characters
-Score of 2 for match and -1 for mismatch 
-Populating a 13x13 Alignment Matix 
-For every mismatch, sides are seen and evaluated accordingly
-No negative values are populated in the matrix. A abs() function is used to do so

Neural Networks with Optimization using Evolutionary Algorithms:
Since genetic algorithms are natural selection based and ACO is using meta-heuristics, genetic algorithms are generally faster because exploring of search space is not done. But the accuracy level does not vary much. hence genetic and cultural algorithms can be considered than aco/pco due to faster speed. But for real time data ACO is one of the best algorithms to use and hence we are in need of such algorithms as well.
